# Custom partion table with two OTA firmware partitions and no factory partition
# Each ota partition is just under 2 MB in size.  In the unlikely event this
# table needs to be changed, make sure that the ota partitions are always the same size.
#
# Keep in mind that ota partition offsets must be aligned to a 0x10000 (64K) byte boundary
